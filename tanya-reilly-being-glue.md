## A cautionary tale of glue!

* New engineer
* Good at joining everyone together - see the gaps and they fill them
* Project couldn't have succeeded without her
* Technical contribution? Are you *really* an engineer?
* Promotion refused because she wasn't doing enough technical work.

## But was it fair?

* Who is doing the non-promotable work in your team?
* If it's just left for volunteers, it will fall to women more often than not

## To manage or not to manage?

* "You must be this socially competent to be a manager"
* What are the skills you want? What do you want to get better at?
* Taking a step away from a more technical role closes doors for junior technical people ("not technical enough")
* Decision time:
  * What would she love to get better at?
  * What will she feel happy and proud to do?
  * What doors are OK to close?
  * Where will she fell supported and safe?

## What to do when you're Glue

1. Have that career conversation
  * Will I get promoted? What do I need to do to get promoted?
1. Get a useful title
  * e.g. "Technical Lead"
  * White or asian men get a free pass - a default assumption of competence
1. Tell the story
  * Due to her work, this thing happened.
  * Write down everything that she did
1. Give up and do exactly the thing on the job ladder
  * "That's not my problem"
  * Don't catch things that are about to drop
  * Don't do diversity work

## Learning

* The vast majority of our learning happens on the job
* You will only get better at what you spend time on
* Be public about learning during work hours
* Don't take learning opportunities from other people
* Let everyone else learn to be better at communication
